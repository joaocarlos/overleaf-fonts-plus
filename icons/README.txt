Placeholder for extension icons.

This project now ships:

- `icons/overleaf-fonts.svg` – source SVG artwork.
- `icons/icon16.png`, `icons/icon32.png`,
  `icons/icon48.png`, `icons/icon128.png` – flat green PNGs
  generated from code, used by Chrome as the actual extension icons.

You can replace the PNGs (and/or the SVG source) with your own
artwork; just keep the same filenames or update `manifest.json`
accordingly.
